        <p><span style="color: white;">Listen only to the sound of my voice.</br>
Let your mind relax. Let your thoughts drift.</br>
Let the bad memories fade.</br>
Let peace be upon you. Surrender yourself to your dreams.</br>
Let them wash over you like the gentle waves of the bluest ocean.</br>
Let them envelop you. Comfort you.</br>

Imagine somewhere calm. Imagine somewhere safe.</br>
Imagine yourself in a frozen forest.</br>
You're standing in a clearing.</br>
Trees around you so tall, they touch the sky.</br>
Pure white snowflakes fall all around.</br>
You can feel them melt on your skin. You are not cold.</br>
It cannot overcome the warmth of your beating heart. Can you hear it? You only have to listen.</br>

You hear it slowing? You are slowing it.</br>
You are in control.</br>
Calm.</br>
At peace.</br></span></p>
